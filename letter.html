  <h1>Happy Valentine's Day Ruby! <br></h1>
  <h2> dear ruby, </h2>
  <p>happy valentine's day! i hope you have enjoyed the website so far. <br>
      i want to start by saying that out of all the gifts that I have given you <br>
      this has got to be by far the one that has taken the most brain power. <br>
      it's currently 1:29 AM when I am writing this because it took me awhile to <br>
      figure out all the technical stuff. <br>
      And I'm telling you this because it's during times like these <br>
      that I find myself unbothered, unphased, and most the time extremely happy to be <br>
      working on something because I know who it's for. it's for the person that i've <br>
      had the pleasure of spending my life with for the past year and a half. <br>
      the person who is the light of everyones' lives, the person who I get to call every night <br>
      and the person who I have the honor of calling my girlfriend.<br>
      On top of making gifts, I have written a fair amount of stuff for you as well and every <br>
      time I say that I do these things because you make it so easy for me. The person <br>
      that you are; your kindness, your humor, your laugh, your smile, your dedication, <br>
      your everything are the reasons why I can pour my heart out into these things for you. <br>
      so thank you ruby. for being the person you are and allowing me to be by your side while <br>
      doing it. <br>

      Love, Ryan
  </p>
